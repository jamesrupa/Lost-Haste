<hr/>

Lost Haste is an open world survival craft game that uses many similar mechanics from games like Minecraft, Rust, and The Forest together to create an immersive gaming experience. It features player vs. environment gameplay, where users must compete against the game’s artificial intelligence. Focus on surviving while monitoring your health, hunger, and thirst. Players must craft, gather, and build the necessary components needed to survive the elements of the outdoors. Players are faced with creatures that can be friendly or dangerous, the only way is to find out. Build, explore, and survive in this first-person fantasy survival game – Lost Haste.

After completion of Lost Haste, many game mechanics were added with over 35 scripts making it possible. Many features such as an inventory system with the ability to clear certain items, a crafting system broken up into various categories, a status bar system that tracks health, hunger, and thirst. Hunger being tracked based on distance traveled and thirst being tracked based on time in the game. A saving/loading system that can be switched between binary or encrypted Json. Game saving stores all information such as players last location, inventory system, and all game objects that were removed from the game. Animals that feature an AI script allowing them to move and stop at random intervals in random directions. The ability to chop trees having independent health/status bars and crafting structures via building menu similar to games like Rust.
